# CS3012 Assignment 1 Interval Scheduling
This program takes a list of intervals represented as pairs of start and end times, and outputs the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that can be scheduled.
## Usage
1. Install Python (version 3 or later) on your computer if it is not already installed.

2. Download the interval_scheduling.py file and the `interval_scheduling.txt` file to the same directory.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are located.

4. Run the program by entering the following command:
`python interval_scheduling.py`

5. The program will read the intervals from the interval_scheduling.txt file and output the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that can be scheduled.

## Input format
The `interval_scheduling.txt` file should contain one interval per line, represented as a pair of start and end times separated by a comma.

## Output format
The program outputs a single integer representing the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that can be scheduled.

## Example
Given the input file above `interval_scheduling.txt`, the program will output:
`4`

This means that the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that can be scheduled is 4.
